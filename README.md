## Rage in the (Nicolas) Cage
### An Exploration of the Nicolas Cage Movie Database

Nicolas Cage has undoubtedly one of the most eclectic filmographies in Hollywood. The same guy that falls in IMDB's top 75 percentile of highest paid actors also has an average Rotten Tomato score of less than 50%. And with over 100 screened roles credited to his name, it can certainly be said that Cage is a guy who is willing to try anything at least 4 times. This project will be mostly exploratory, taking a deep dive into the career of Ole Saint Nick. Then, I'll build a reccomendation system that will deliver suggestions of other films you might enjoy based off of similarity in Genre.
